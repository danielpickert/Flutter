## Daniel's Summary of Flutter
Flutter is an open-source UI framework created by Google. 

I wanted to learn Flutter because it involves developing mobile applications for different types of phones at the same time (iPhone and Android).

Prior to Flutter, as far as I know, mobile applications could only be developed for 1 type of phone at a time. This way, we can develop 1 application that will apply to different phones instead of having to create it multiple times.

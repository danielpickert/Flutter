## Summary of Flutter
Flutter is an open-source UI framework created by Google. 

I wanted to learn Flutter because it involves developing mobile applications for different types of phones at the same time (iPhone and Android).

Prior to Flutter, as far as I know, mobile applications could only be developed for 1 type of phone at a time. This way, we can develop 1 application that will apply to different phones instead of having to create it multiple times.

The biggest hurdle while building this was that all the instructions related to VS Code, not Sublime. I was able to install some extensions/plug-ins for Sublime couldn't find others, like "Flutter: Run Flutter Doctor".

After seeing Flutter's syntax, I noticed it was similar to React. Instead of components however, they are called Stateless Widgets. Instead of a constructor, you type @override. A few resources I would recommend for learning Flutter are Flutter.io as well as YouTube tutorials.
